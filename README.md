🎯 **Backend Code**: [GitHub – ToDoBackend](https://github.com/Adil-9995/ToDoBackend)

This is a fully functional **To-Do Web Application** built using the **MERN stack** during DevTown's 5-Day Bootcamp.  
It allows users to **register, log in, add, update, delete, and filter tasks** with a polished, mobile-responsive UI.
